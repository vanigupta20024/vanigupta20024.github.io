								<p>I am a student majoring in Computer Applications, currently in my freshman year. I find myself often lost in writing codes or learning various new things. Strong coffee and music is always something I turn to when frustration dwells in. But writing code is not the only thing I do. I love reading books and I find myself often lost amidst beautiful non-fictions, crime-thriller fiction and self-help books. </p>
								<p>I help other fellow students in their assignments or by correcting their codes. I find myself often stuck up with challenging doubts which helps me in brainstorming and has in turn made me a better problem solver over time. I go on long walks and feed stray animals whenever I get time. I consider myself as a philomath, and anything intrigues me.</p>

								<p>Since I am a full time student, I have volunteered for various open source projects and interned in various roles. I have been an active technical content writing intern with GeeksforGeeks from the past 3 months. I have also contributed to a lot of open source projects under the Girlscript Summer of Code'20. Currently I am a project intern at LNM Institute of Information Technology. I am also a moderator at the Uplift project by the Girlscript foundation for the Data Structures and Algorithms stack.</p>
								<p>Besides this, I mentor a lot of students who face difficulty in problem solving or need any help regarding technical related subjects. I have been a Campus Ambassador with Coding Blocks and helped them make business driven decisions and promote their courses among other students.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I find myself skilled in Data structures and Algorithms. I am proficient in multiple programming languages like C, Java, Cpp, Python, Js, Html, Kotlin and have basic hands on experience with Go, C#, Rust and TypeScript. I have a good understanding of Version Control, automation using python, web scraping and machine learning. I have recently made a data visualisation model as a proof of concept. I also have limited expertise in the Linux operating system and cybersecurity. I have recently learned Web development and made some mini-projects using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I am currently learning Android app development using Kotlin and side by side furnishing my skills in the Data Science domain.</p>
								<p>Apart from my technical skills, I am working to improve my public speaking skills. I am seasoned in team-work and decision making. I have remarkable interpersonal and social skills which in turn has helped me a lot to build good professional relations. </p>
